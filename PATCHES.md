# Local patches to the vendored frontend

Keep this list short. Every patch here has to be carried across `git subtree pull`.

| Patch | Files | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend/LICENSE` added | `frontend/LICENSE` | Upstream keeps its MIT licence at the repo root, outside `dashboard/` |

Planned: hide tabs whose capability `/api/state` reports as unavailable (PRD 002).
